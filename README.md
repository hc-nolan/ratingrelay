# Introduction

**Relay** loved track **ratings** from Plex to ListenBrainz and/or Last.FM.

ListenBrainz also supports hated tracks.

The relay is one-way from Plex to the other services - Plex track ratings will not be modified.

The script will un-love/hate tracks, but only ones that it added. This way, if you have existing loved/hated tracks that you manually set, they won't be removed.

# Usage

Fill out the required values. If using Docker, these are in `docker-compose.yml`. Otherwise, rename `env.example` to `.env` and set them there.

- `SERVER_URL`: the URL of your Plex server
- `MUSIC_LIBRARY`: by default, this is set to "Music". If your library is named something else, change this value.
- `LOVE_THRESHOLD`: by default, this is set to 10 (5 stars). Ratings are out of 10, so 1 star in the Plex UI = 2/10.
  - (optional) `HATE_THRESHOLD`: If you want to use hated tracks with ListenBrainz, uncomment this.
- ListenBrainz and/or Last.FM API values
  - Fill out one or both of these sets of values.

## Docker Compose

After setting the required environment variables, you must manually authenticate with Plex. To do so, run:
```bash
sudo docker compose run --rm ratingrelay
```

You should be prompted for your Plex authentication details. After this you can either let the script finish or press `Ctrl+C` to finish it.

Then, you can set the container to execute however often you like. You can change the frequency on this line:
```yml
      ofelia.job-run.ratingrelay.schedule: "@every 24h" # how often to run
```

After everything is set up, run:
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Python

- [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)
- In the repository directory, run `uv sync --frozen`
- Run the script with: `uv run /path/to/repo/ratingrelay.py`
  - **Note**: The first time the script runs, you will be prompted to enter your Plex authentication details.
  - If you wish, you can also run with `/path/to/repo/.venv/bin/python /path/to/repo/ratingrelay.py`

To run on a regular basis, set up a cronjob (Linux) or Scheduled Task (Windows).
