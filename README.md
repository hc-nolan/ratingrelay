# Introduction

Relay ratings from Plex to ListenBrainz or Last.fm based on a defined Plex rating threshold.

For example, setting `RATING_THRESHOLD=6` will consider any tracks with 3 star ratings or higher to be Loved Tracks. `RATING_THRESHOLD=10` would consider only tracks with 5 star ratings.

As of v0.3.0, Last.fm and ListenBrainz are supported. Other services such as Libre.fm will be added in future versions. If there is a service you would like to be added, please submit a new issue with the details.

# Usage

Please see the [usage guide](./usage.md) to learn how to use RatingRelay.
